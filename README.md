# EPQ - Generals.io AI

A NN AI for Generals.io

## Setup
1. Download repo
2. `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. python main.py

## Usage
1. Wait for map to finish drawing
2. Click 'New Game' & wait for someone to join (or go to http://bot.generals.io/ and play 1v1 to match with it)

Currently there is no way to move the player's army, only watch as it is eventually defeated by the opponent.

## TODO
- [x] Actually implement NN AI  
- [x] Rotate map  
- [ ] More options on config panel  
- [x] Comment Code
- [x] Colour code for the map
